- [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/docs/) is a React binding to Three.js, enabling developers to integrate powerful 3D graphics and visualizations into React applications seamlessly.

- [**Three Drei**](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) is a collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three.js applications. It provides components like effects, shaders, and pre-built 3D objects to simplify development.

- [**Three Fiber**](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) optimizes the React binding for Three.js, utilizing React's reconciliation algorithm (Fiber) to efficiently manage and update the 3D scene graph.

- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a modern build tool that prioritizes speed and efficiency for frontend development. It offers rapid server start-up, instant hot module replacement (HMR), and supports modern JavaScript features out of the box.

- [**Tailwind**](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) is a utility-first CSS framework that facilitates rapid UI development by applying pre-defined utility classes directly in HTML markup, eliminating the need for writing custom CSS.

- [**EmailJS**](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/) is a service that simplifies email sending from client-side JavaScript applications. It provides APIs for integrating email functionality without backend setup, making it easier to manage email communication in frontend projects.
